;;Overview
;;========

;;Helmet is a re-write of a stochastic demand sampling.  The legacy version 
;;was an unnamed tool, built in excel, that used a worksheet interface, and 
;;a VBA backend.  The VBA implementation parsed data from a set of tables that
;;encoded sampling rules, primarily mappings of distributions and data 
;;transformations to subsets of a corpus of data records.  The sponsor extended
;;the requirements after the tool had been built, and the original developer 
;;was no longer around.  Unfortunately, the implementation precluded simple 
;;extension to handle the non-trivial cases that the requirements change 
;;introduced.  Additionally, there were previously unknown errors in the 
;;implementation that surfaced during early attempts to capitalize on the 
;;previous effort and extend it.  
;;After roughly 3 weeks of wasted effort, I made the decision to implement the 
;;sampling language in spork.util.sampling to support sampling rules of 
;;arbitrary complexity.  That language now serves as the basis for the 
;;stochastic demand rule engine.  To support legacy users, I wrapped the 
;;legacy interface (with some improvements) that existed in Excel.  The new 
;;application, dubbed Helmet, is a wrapper around the sampling rules and "cases"
;;encoded in the legacy Excel format.  One should note: the sampling is a 
;;general purpose clojure library.  Helmet is merely a wrapper and a specialized
;;Excel data-munging tool to accomodate legacy users.  Callers may use Helmet 
;;from the standard Marathon GUI, or may use the library programatically.  

;;Differences from the Legacy Version
;;===================================

;;Helmet capitalizes on the fact that Clojure has a really powerful reader.  As
;;such, much of the "data" in the casebook (an Excel workbook with some required
;;tables) is actually a native clojure data structure (like a map or a vector).
;;I was able to simplify much of the case definition, and provide the ability 
;;to compose sampling rules to eliminate much of the redundancy in the previous
;;spec.  Legacy users seemed to like the new format.  There is a detailed 
;;description of new data fields and rule expression semantics, available on 
;;request.  Later versions may ignore Excel entirely, preferring simple clojure
;;scripts and database connections for portability.  

;;Typical Process
;;===============
;;When invoked as an application from the main Marathon GUI, the user is 
;;presented with a file selection dialogue asking for a casebook.  The 
;;path of the casebook is fed to the __xlsx->futures__ function, with default
;;arguments.  Assuming the casebook is well-formed, a set of stochastically 
;;generated demand futures, as defined by the demand data, the sampling rules, 
;;and the case data from the casebook, will be generated in the same working 
;;folder.  These futures are standard tables of tab-delimited txt, and can be
;;easily read or modified.  Alternative formats are feasible, but currently not
;;in demand.  

;;If a user wishes to perform the same process from the clojure REPL, one can
;;do so via invoking (xlsx->futures ...) on an appropriate workbook path.  Check
;;the __xlsx->futures__ docstring for more options for output configuration.

;;Required Data
;;=============


;;Cases
;;=====

;;The "Cases" table defines the name and global characteristics of active cases
;;to be sampled from.  Global characteristics include the number of futures to
;;generate, the random number seed to use, and constraints on duration and 
;;end-times.  Each enabled case in the "Cases" table must have a corresponding 
;;table (or worksheet) that defines the sampling rules for the case.  

;;Case Sampling Rules
;;===================
;;Each case has a table of sampling rules that define a sampling context, ala 
;;__spork.util.sampling__.  The rows or records of the case table contribute 
;;a sampling rule to the sampling corpus, so all of the records for a case are
;;parsed into a composite sampling rule for the entire case.  When a case is 
;;sampled according to these rules, the result of each rule - a sequence of 
;;demand records -- are concatenated into a single "future".  Each case will 
;;have n futures, as defined by the information in the Cases table.  Each future
;;will ultimately reside in a unique tab-delimited file (when default processing
;;is used).  If a caller desires to, they can use the library functions directly
;;and keep case information in-memory as spork.util.table structures, rather 
;;than emitting files.  This may be useful for later experimental processes, or 
;;search processes such as __marathon.processing.stoke__.  

;;The sampling rules are encoded in a tabular format, where each rule has a name, 
;;a frequency, a distribution to transform the "start" field of sampled records 
;;by, a distribution to transform the "duration" field of sampled records by, 
;;and a pool of rules to draw from.  Both the start and distribution fields have
;;accompying values of "S1, S2, S3", and "D1, D2, D3" .  These are remnants of 
;;the legacy incoding, and imply the paramters to be sent to the distribution 
;;named in the associated "... Distribution" field.  This encoding only covers
;;the cases needed for Helmet, but is sufficient and conforms to the legacy 
;;design.

;;Encoding Pools of Choices
;;=========================

;;The pool of rules is either a clojure vector or a clojure map.  Clojure 
;;vectors, denoted by [...] imply a random choice with even probability amongst 
;;every rule in the sequence.  Users may enter multiple identical values for a 
;;vector pool, in which case the result is akin to an empirical distribution.  
;;Users may also prepend the vector sequence with the :every keyword,  
;;[:every ...]  to imply that, rather than a uniform choice, every rule in the 
;;pool is to be sampled and concatenated.  

;;Clojure maps, denoted by {rule1 n1, rule2 n2, ...} imply a weighted choice, 
;;with probability denoted by the numerical values associated with each rule.  
;;While a preferred convention, numerical values need not sum to 1.0 - they will
;;be normalized by default.  One may encode an empirical distribution by 
;;weighting the rules in the map with the number of observations.

;;Validation Rules : Dependency Classes and Prioritization
;;========================================================
;;Validation covers two depenendent phenomena: prioritzation of demands, and 
;;the desire to resolve "collisions" between classes of prioritized demands.  
;;The "ValidationRules" table contains a dependency class, a priority, and a 
;;minimum time rule.  Dependency classes, when present, encode a prioritization 
;;between concurrent demands, if and only, the concurrent demands also have 
;;a dependency class.  Concurrent dependent demands, or collisions, are then 
;;resolved based on the rules in __marathon.processing.helmet.collision__ .  In
;;general, demands are either merged or split, depending on priority, to resolve
;;collisions.  Demands with no associated dependency class are left untouched.  

;;Demand Splitting
;;================
;;One orthogonal requirement that emerged was the ability to split a group of 
;;demands according to context-specific rule-sets, where the "splitting" 
;;operation implied bifurcating demand records based on some notion of 
;;cumulative time relative to the group of demand records.  I decided to split
;;this into a final processing step, separate from the sampling rules.  Once 
;;samples are determing, if any splitting needs to be done - to identify "early"
;;demands in a logical group of demands [presumably for special policies] - 
;;then we split the demand records according to information in the DemandSplit 
;;table.  Where demand records map to a DemandSplit rule, the rule will detail
;;when a set of demands should be "split."  Splitting occurs relative to the 
;;earliest demand in the group of demand records sharing the split rule.  If 
;;the split-day, the day since the start of the earlist demand in the group, 
;;occurs during any demands, then the intersecting demands are bifurcated.  
;;Birfurcation creates two records, one defined up to the split, where the 
;;data is identical except for the duration.  Any records occuring after the 
;;split have - currently - "-Rotational" appened to their "SourceFirst" fields,
;;as dictated by the legacy methodology.

;;Demand Records
;;==============
;;The "DemandRecords" table is effectively the sampling corpus for the entire 
;;set of sampling rules, across all cases.  Upon initialization, a sampling 
;;context is defined, where demand records are grouped into sampling rules by 
;;their "Group" field.  These rules are therefore available for use in composing
;;the rules found in the __Case Sampling Rules__ and the pools.  The other field
;;of consequence is the "DemandSplit" field, which is used for the final 
;;processing step.



;;Implementation
;;==============

;;Most of the following implementation concerns reading data from the casebook, 
;;and parsing tabular data into so-called "Cases" which describe the set of 
;;active cases to sample.  The casebook is read into a spork.util.table 
;;structure, acting as a lightweight database simulacrum of the casebook.
